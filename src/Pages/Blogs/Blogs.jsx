        <p className="my-8 ml-10 mr-6" > <span className="text-lg " >Answer</span> <br /> Data binding in Angular can be categorized into two types- One-way data binding and two-way data binding. These two help exchange data from component to DOM, and vice-versa. The process is quite similar to that of the MVC architecture in terms of how the data is exchanged or synchronized between View to Model and Model to View. In Angular, the data exchange between the component and view assists us in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. </p>

        {/* <p className="my-8 ml-10 mr-6" >Letâ€™s first understand what data binding is</p> */}
        <p className="my-8 ml-10 mr-6" >One-way data binding in Angular  is a way to bind data from the component to the view (DOM) or vice versa - from view to the component. It is used to display information to the end-user which automatically stays synchronized with each change of the underlying data.</p>
